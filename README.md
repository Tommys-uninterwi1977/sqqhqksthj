Honestly, I don't know how I feel after walking out of The Electric State. It's like my brain's been fried on low voltage but it's still rattling with static whooshes and clunky mechanical noises. You know that feeling when you leave your charger plugged in, even when the phone's already at 100%? Yeah, that's it... so full of something and yet inexplicably drained.

I mean, the visuals! Oh boy, the visuals. They’re like this bizarre dream kaleidoscope, if dreams had CGI budgets. There were scenes where I had to legit remind myself to blink. The world in that movie? Very “what if a Transformer got therapy and decided it was into existential crisis chic?” The I-need-a-tetnus-shot kind of gorgeous, if you catch what I mean.

But I can’t lie, there were parts where it felt like the story took a vacation without telling us where it went. Talking about fragmented, right? Half the time I was leaning forward, whispering Wait - what? to confuse my popcorn as much as myself. It's like they tried to shoehorn a novella into the backseat of a Mini Cooper. You're there, trying to enjoy the ride, but your knees are in your chest and you can't feel your toes.

>You know that feeling when you’re having a decent day, but then someone sprays Axe body spray like it's Febreze? That's how some of the dialogue hit me. A bit too over-ambitious, leaving me squinting like—did that make sense or am I just in too deep? 

Honestly, the actors deserve a medal for making it largely work. Oh, and note to self: ask someone if being endearingly perplexed is a marketable skill. Clearly, I've not underestimated it enough.

By the way, there’s this one robot - it’s like they snatched up all the emo artists’ mid-2000s heartbreak and gutted it through circuitry. Wondering if anyone else saw that or if I have just marinated in too much high-contrast lighting. Let me know if you download the movie to see what I’m talking about.

   console.log('Are we even real?');
}

And speaking of surreal – thinking about designing shoes inspired by this movie? They’d probably have gears that don’t really do anything except look unnecessarily complex. Perfect for trips where you wanna say I'm too cool to understand my footwear, am I right?

Anyway, maybe give it a whirl or just let it filter through whatever’s left of blockbuster popcorn haze in your head. Catch it when the moment feels right, or just let it simmer in the back of your mind like that weird quirky mural in your uncle's garage.
